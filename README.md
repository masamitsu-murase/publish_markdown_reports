# Publish Markdown reports

This is an **extension for Azure Pipelines** to publish Markdown files in a tab in a build result page.

I developed this extension to show **Markdown files**, which are automatically generated in a pipeline, such as a document generated by [jsdoc-to-markdown](https://github.com/jsdoc2md/jsdoc-to-markdown) and [Doxybook2](https://github.com/matusnovak/doxybook2).

## Overview

This extension adds a "Markdown reports" tab to a build result page as follows:
